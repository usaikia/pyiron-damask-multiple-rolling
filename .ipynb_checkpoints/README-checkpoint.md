# pyiron DAMASK multiplerolling simulation
This is an example repository of how you can run a [DAMASK](https://damask-multiphysics.org/index.html) multiplerolling simulation in pyiron.

This introduces users to the python-interface of pyiron and how to:
- access material parameters from a ontology powered datbase Dataspace Management System [(DSMS).](https://dsms-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/dsms.html)
- setup and run DAMASK multiplerolling simulation.
- access the output and plot some basic quantities, etc.
